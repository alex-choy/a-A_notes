```ruby
a = [1,2,3,4,5]
b = [6,7,8,9,10]

a.zip(b) # [[1,6],[2,7],[3,8],[4,9],[5,10]]
```



**a.select vs a.select!**

```ruby
a = [1,2,3,4,5]
b = [1,2,3,4,5]

p a.select{|x| x > 2} 	# [3,4,5]
p b.select!{|x| x > 2}	# [3,4,5]

p a											# [1,2,3,4,5]
p b											# [3,4,5]
```



if we have a block, that's the very last argument in our parameters. Procs can go wherever in the parameters.
